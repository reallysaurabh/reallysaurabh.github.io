title: #IVoted to #IGotPwned: Studying Voter Privacy Leaks in Indian Lok Sabha Elections on Twitter
---

# Abstract
  Online Social Networks (OSNs) play a crucial role in elections worldwide. Users post their opinions and sentiments on events, candidates, and parties. One of the cardinal principles in elections is to ensure that the party (or candidate) to which a citizen vote remains secret. However, given that citizens are free to express their opinions and views on OSN platforms like Twitter, some of them, in direct and indirect ways, reveal their political inclinations, which we refer to as Voter Privacy Leaks (VPL). In this paper, we make three major contributions. First, we propose a computational framework to collect VPL incidents on Twitter and perform a characterization study on users involved in VPL behavior. Second, when we cross-link VPL user's online details with other publicly available information (like electoral rolls, which is a list of all eligible voters), we get access to their personally identifiable information (PII) including their voter ID, age, gender, address, and family details. Finally, to safeguard such users, we develop browser plugin based nudge that leverages machine learning-based classifiers to flag a given post on Twitter as a VPL or a Non-VPL, thereby helping users protect their voter privacy. To validate our approach, we focus on the period of Lok Sabha elections held in 2019 in India, the largest democracy in the world. We collect tweets starting from April 11, 2019, to May 22, 2019. We detect 91,253 instances of VPL and using a subset of electoral rolls, successfully cross-link 44 Twitter users to their exact PII. Our proposed nudge detects 93\% of VPL incidents.
